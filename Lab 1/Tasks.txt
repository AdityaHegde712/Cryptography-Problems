1) Create a python program to encrypt and decrypt using affine cipher. Take both key values from the user. 
Ask user whether to encrypt or decrypt
a has 12 values, as a-1 must exist. 
Enc - y = ax + b mod 26. 
Dec - x = a-1(y-b) mod 26

2) Write a python program to encrypt and decrypt using piglatin. Move the first 2 letters of each word in a sentence to the end and add 'ay'.

Use python, avoid using any external libraries.
